## Slots

### `node`

Use this slot to customize the rendering of individual node. 

Note that the markup will be rendered inside an SVG element, so only [SVG elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element) are allowed here.

Slot-scope:


| Name          | Type      | Description  |
| ---           | ---       | ---   |
| `actions`     | `Object`  | Value: `{collapse, collapseAll, expand, expandAll, setSelected, show, toggleExpandCollapse}`, where each property is a component method (See [below](#Methods) for detailed description) |
| `data`        | `Object`  | node data, as provided by the `data` prop  |
| `isRetracted` | `Boolean` | `true` if the node has hidden children _retracted state_ |
| `isSelected`  | `Boolean` | `true` if the node is selected |
| `node`        | [D3.js node](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/tree/v1.1.8#hierarchy) | D3.js node to be displayed  |
| `radius`      | `Number`  | tree radius props value    |

Example:
```HTML
<template #node="{data, node: {depth}, radius, isRetracted}">
  <template v-if="data.children && data.children.length">
    <path :fill="isRetracted? 'red' : 'blue'" d="M190.5..">
      <title>{{data.text}} {{depth}}</title>
    </path>
  </template>
  <template v-else>
    <circle r="6" :stroke="blue? 'blue' : 'yellow'">
      <title>{{data.text}} {{depth}}</title>
    </circle>
  </template>
</template>
```

### `popUp`

Use this slot to create a pop-up, tooltip, or context menu for nodes. The position of the pop-up relative to its target is defined by the `popUpPlacement` prop.

By default, pop-up will open when clicking on node text. This behavior can be overridden using the `behavior` slot. For example, using the `PopUpOnTextHover` component provides opening of pop-up when hovering the node test. See below for example.


Slot-scope:


| Name      | Type          | Description  |
| ---       | ---           | ---   |
| `data`    | `Object`      | node data as provided by the `data` props  |
| `close`   | `Function`    | function to close the pop-up |
| `node`    | [D3.js node](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/tree/v1.1.8#hierarchy) | D3.js node to be displayed  |

Example:
```HTML
<template #popUp="{data,node}">
  <div class="btn-group-vertical">
    <button @click="addFor(data)">
      <i class="fa fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    </button>
    <button @click="remove(data, node)">
      <i class="fa fa-trash" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    </button>
  </div>
</template>
```

### `behavior`

[Behavior slots](https://alligator.io/vuejs/renderless-behavior-slots/) provide an elegant way to customize the tree behavior by receiving as `slot-scope` both node information (including clicked node, hovered node, ...) and actions to alter the graph accordingly.

The purpose of this slot is to react to changes in node information by calling an action.

By design, this slot is renderless.

For more about this pattern, [check here](https://alligator.io/vuejs/renderless-behavior-slots/).

Slot-scope:


| Name       | Type         | Description  |
| ---        | ---          | ---   |
| `on`       | `Function`   | Value: `$on` method of the tree component, exposing all events |
| `actions`   | `Object`    | Value: `{collapse, collapseAll, expand, expandAll, setSelected, show, toggleExpandCollapse}` where each property is a component method (see [below](#Methods) for detailed description) |

By default, tree components use `standardBehavior` as component, which provides toggling retract on clicking a node, and selecting the node on clicking on its text.

Example:

```HTML
<tree>
  <template #behavior="{on, actions}">
    <CollapseOnClick v-bind="{on, actions}"/>
  </template>
</tree>
```

With `CollapseOnClick` component:
```javascript
export default {
  props: ['on', 'actions'],

  render: () => null,

  created () {
    const {on, actions: {toggleExpandCollapse}} = this;

    on('clickedNode', ({element}) => {
      toggleExpandCollapse(element);
    })
  }
}
```


To display pop-up on hover, use the built-in `popUpOnHoverText`:

```HTML
<tree>
  <template #behavior="{on, actions}">
    <popUpOnHoverText v-bind="{on, actions}"/>
  </template>
</tree>
```

```javascript
import {tree, popUpOnHoverText} from 'vued3tree'

export default {
  components: {
    tree,
    popUpOnHoverText
  },
  //...
```

## Events

### `change`
  - Argument : node raw data.
  - Sent when the node is selected

### `clickedNode`
  - Argument : `{element, data, target}` where `element` represents the node build by `D3.js`, `data` is the node raw data and `target` the target DOM element.
  - Sent when the node is clicked


### `clickOutside`
  - Argument: none
  - Sent when mouse is clicked outside any geometry or text of the tree

### `clickedText`
  - Argument: same as [`mouseNodeOver`](#mouseNodeOver)
  - Sent when the node text is clicked

### `expand`
  - Argument : same as [`clicked`](#clicked).
  - Sent when the node is clicked and the node children are expanded

### `mouseOverText`
  - Argument: same as [`mouseNodeOver`](#mouseNodeOver)
  - Sent when mouse hovers the node text

### `onNodeTextLeave`
  - Argument: same as [`mouseNodeOver`](#mouseNodeOver)
  - Sent when mouse leaves the node text

### `retract`
  - Argument : same as [`clicked`](#clicked).
  - Sent when the node is clicked and the node children are retracted


All of the above events receive the argument `{element, data}`.

## `zoom`
  - Argument : `{transform}`, where `transform` is [`d3.zoom` transform object](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom#zoom-transforms).
  - Sent when the tree is zoomed.

## Gotchas

This component is responsive and will adjust to resizing.

In order for this to work properly, you must define for this component or its parent whether:
  * a `height` or a `max-height`; OR,
  * a `width` or a `max-width`.
  
Failing to do so may result in a component whose size that will keep increasing.
